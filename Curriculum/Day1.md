Day 1: Building the robot from scratch (3 hours)
======================================

Students are often asked if they really built the robot, in this excercise they will do just that all the way from the box


## Github 

The first activity is for students to each create a github account.

If they already have a github account they can work on:

* helping other students
* friending other students
* selecting a gravatar
* browsing the [octodex](http://octodex.github.com/)

## Storytime -- Maker Movement 

Discuss the story of Hackerspaces 

1. building the box

2. tracing location for the motors 

## Introduction to hot glue

demo the usage of the hot glue gun 

3. hot gluing the motors

4. hot glueing the wheels (cd parts)

## Cutting the box 

An introduction to subtractive process construction.

I handle this for safety, but it doesn't take that long

5. cutting the holes for the wires of the servo motors

6. tracing the location of arduino

7. tracing holes for barrel and programming port

8. cutting out the holes

9. placing the arduino abd hot glueing corners 

10. placing in the protoboard (removing tape)
