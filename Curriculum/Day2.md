Wiring the Robot and Loading the Demo Code
================

> 3 Hours

In this class, students will complete the wiring of the robot and load the demo program.


Outline:
--------

Wiring

* Story of Electricity
  * how electricity works
  * The uController
    * can program it
    * keeps the code even if you turn it off 
  * Servo Motors
    * high voltage
    * lower voltage
    * Control Wire (_spinal cord_)
  * Students follow instructions to try to connect motors
    * there aren't enough pins for the 5V???
  * Enter the solderless protoboard
    * it makes more 5V pins
  * Wiring up everything through the solderless protoboard
  * Mechanical
    * Making sure the wires are in place
      * fix wires with small amount of hot glue

Programming

  * How to use github 
    * navigate to "Raw" code from Robox Repository
  * How to use Arduino
    * paste "Raw" Code into Arduino
    * Upload using the :arrow_forward: key
