Programming

> 3 hours


Today we program the robot to move in different patterns.

> Students will be learning C, it will be hard but their motivation to build the robot will get them through the learning-process.

> Also, since they are learning C (as opposed to scratch etc) it can be forwarded as valuable and is truly impressive (what NASA uses).


The goal today's class is for students to gain familiarity with the flow:

programming, compiling + uploading, testing, :repeat: 

This process in itself is a valuable skill.

the project goals of today's class are to have the robot move around in different patterns using basic commands.

 the details of C-programming which the instructor should prepare mentally for:


Easy Things:
the Arduino isn't plugged in
the battery isn't plugged in, lol
the upload button wasn't pressed

Programming things:
Missing ";"
Space Sensitive
Spelling Sensitive
Case Sensitive
Missing "}" when copying


Projects:
Change the order of the commands
Change the duration of the commands
Time the robot to Turn the Corner of the outside wall
Time the robot to Turn the Corner of the outside wall and return


Time the robot to Turn the Corner of the outside wall and return + have an adult send a note inside of it.


Extra Credit:

Have it do this only once (by placing the code in the Setup phase, and a delay to occupy the loop phase, don't leave the loop phase empty)
