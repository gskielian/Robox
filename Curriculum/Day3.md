Programming

> 3 hours


Today we program the robot to move in different patterns.

> Students will be learning C, it will be hard but their motivation to build the robot will get them through the learning-process.

> Also, since they are learning C (as opposed to scratch etc) it can be forwarded as valuable and is truly impressive (what NASA uses).


The goal today's class is for students to gain familiarity with the flow:

programming, compiling + uploading, testing, :repeat: 

This process in itself is a valuable skill.

the project goals of today's class are to have the robot move around in different patterns using basic commands.

 the details of C-programming which the instructor should prepare mentally for:


Easy Things:
the Arduino isn't plugged in
the battery isn't plugged in, lol
the upload button wasn't pressed

Programming things:
Missing ";"
Space Sensitive
Spelling Sensitive
Case Sensitive
Missing "}" when copying
