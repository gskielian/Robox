Robox
=====

Just follow the steps below to construct the Robox (png included above). 


##Building, Wiring and Programming.

###Slideshow: The Making of Robox
Use the following as a guide for constructing and installing the Motors, Protoboard, and the Funduino into the box.

###Wiring Diagrams (PNG files):
After physically installing (and taping down) the Motors, Arduino, and Protoboard, we need to wire these up : )

###Programs && Code: 

Lastly, upload these code via the Arduino IDE and mod them to your liking

1) <a href="https://github.com/gskielian/Robox/blob/master/Step%203%20Coding/AvoidWalls.ino" > AvoidWalls.ino</a>       //Utilizes the HC-SR04 wired as in the Robox.fzz fritzing file (extends from MotorController.ino)

2) <a href="https://github.com/gskielian/Robox/blob/master/Step%203%20Coding/MotorController_v_3.0.ino"> MotorController.ino</a>  //Abstraction off the public domain Servo-Sweep from Arduino's Example Menu (Credits <a href="http://barraganstudio.com">Barragan</a>), and the Servo.h library 



###Description
Students truly build, wire, and program a robot completely using off the shelf components (a funduino, jumper wires, continuous-rotation servos, a 9V battery, and a 9V holder, a protoboard, and a cardboard container).

###Credits

Contained in this file is the fruits of collaboration between awesome coders and educators who envision use of this platform in their classes.

Credits to Nicky Ringland of Sydney University for naming the robot, coding the Direction-Decision-Making code (Based on measurements from the Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor), and for creating the slideshow which covers construction (link here).
(Thanks also for providing the name for the project). 

Credits to Chris Newton for his enthusiasm, support, and offering use of his classroom's computers for the afterschool activity.  
We worked out a way to control the robot movement more intuitively 
(
Forward(100);//drive the motors 100%-power forward 
delay(1000);//wait 1 second
//etc.
)

Credits to Conor Hayes for his contributions to the Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor based Direction-Decision-Making code posted here.
We worked together on a software-patch for fixing the mysterious behavior which only showed itself when powered from the 9V battery and not when plugged into the computer.  
This was resolved via briefly suspending servo-signaling-and-movement during the distance-measurements.

Credits to students who came to Viz Valley Middle School's Afterschool-Robotics-Activity for their innovations and improvements to the Robo

Credits to William and Jane Fujimoto for their work and enthusiasm through the prototyping stages.

Credits to <a href="http://www.techlabeducation.com">TechLab Education</a> for their investment in continued development of the open-source platform.
